## How this app works

 - The app will show the list of candidates and will show you the counter what is the current # of the vote.
 
 

 
 - Then, it will ask for the name of the voter
 

 
 - After that, it will now ask for the # of your candidate


 
 - Now, the vote will be counted. Then it will ask for the next voter. If type y, it will go back to the list of candidates with the vote counted.
 


 
 - if type n, it will now close the system and will show the tally of votes
